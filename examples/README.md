## Contributing Examples

Have a good example of MixtapeTools in use? Consider contributing:

1. Create a folder with a descriptive name
2. Include source files, output, and a README explaining:
   - What the example demonstrates
   - What tools/prompts you used
   - What the iterative process caught/fixed
3. Sanitize any sensitive content (student names, unpublished results)
4. Submit a PR

Examples that show the *process* (before/after, what got caught) are more valuable than just polished outputs.
