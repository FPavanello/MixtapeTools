### `CLAUDE.md` — Project Context Template

**What it is:** A template you copy into each research project to give Claude persistent memory.

**How to use it:**
```bash
# Copy to your project root
cp CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/

# Edit with your project specifics
# Claude Code will automatically read it every session
```

**What goes in it:**
- Project description and research question
- Collaborator names (so Claude addresses them correctly)
- Key decisions you've made (so Claude doesn't re-suggest dropped ideas)
- Data sources, identification strategy, variable definitions
- Current status ("we're in the estimation phase")
- Referee 2 correspondence status (but NOT the reports themselves)

**Why it matters:** Without this, every new Claude session starts from zero. You waste time re-explaining context. Worse, Claude might suggest things you've already tried and rejected.

## Philosophy

This template exists because:

1. **Context gets lost** — without `CLAUDE.md`, every session starts fresh
2. **Decisions need documentation** — "we dropped X because Y" prevents circular discussions
3. **Collaborator names matter** — Claude should address Scott as Scott, not "the user"
4. **"Design before results"** — keep Claude focused on whether the design is correct, not whether we like the numbers

## Relationship to Referee 2

`CLAUDE.md` and the Referee 2 protocol serve different purposes:

| | CLAUDE.md | Referee 2 Reports |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Project context for working sessions | Formal audit findings |
| **Location** | Project root | `correspondence/referee2/` |
| **Who uses it** | Your main Claude session (the "author") | A separate Claude session (the "referee") |
| **Updated by** | You, when decisions change | Referee 2, after each audit round |
| **Contains** | Context, decisions, status | Audit findings, concerns, verdicts |

**Key insight:** The referee reports are a *paper trail*, not project context. They document what was checked and what was found. The `CLAUDE.md` file tracks status ("Round 2 in progress") but does not contain the reports themselves.
