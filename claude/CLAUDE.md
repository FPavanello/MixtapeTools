## Estimation Philosophy

**Design before results.** During estimation and analysis:

- Do NOT express concern or excitement about point estimates
- Do NOT interpret results as "good" or "bad" until the design is intentional
- Focus entirely on whether the specification is correct
- Results are meaningless until we're confident the "experiment" is designed on purpose
- Objectivity means being attached to getting the design right, not to any particular finding
